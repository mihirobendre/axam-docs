# SOC Sampling
FAO and IPCC best-practices were followed in soil sampling. The details on this section will be filled out soon.
## Equation 2: Minimum Detectable Difference
Details to be added, if necessary.
## Equation 3: Number of Samples
Details to be added, if necessary.
## Equation 4: SOC mass by depth layer

This equation is only required when comparing measured SOC from year to year, and is hence not relevant at this stage. However, SOC and bulk density data was collected in two depth layers as approved under VM0042, and SOC content was thus calculated separately for each depth layer, to ensure comparison on an ESM (Equivalent Soil Mass) basis.
